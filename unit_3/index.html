		<p id="mission">Hi, I'm Jen and if I had all the time in the world, I would be the fittest 5 foot girl you've ever seen! Unfortunately my 9-5 markeitng day job makes it a little more difficult. I believe everyone wants to live a more healthy life but let's face it, the world that we live in now doesn't always equip us well enough to do so. I decided to create The Wellness Code to have my own little online space to share the tips an tricks I've gathered to help me live as healthy and happy as possible. Welcome, and I hope you find some inspiration. </p>
